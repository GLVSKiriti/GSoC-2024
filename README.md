# Description üìú
Falco is a real-time security tool designed to detect abnormal behaviours and security-related runtime events in Linux systems and the cloud. The event-generator is an utility within the Falco ecosystem that helps testing Falco‚Äôs detection capabilities. The tool also has benchmark capabilities that represent a building block of the Falco performance testing practices. However, the project received less attention than required in the past few years and would require some care and renovation. 

# Goals üéØ
This Google Summer of Code project proposes upgrading the event-generator to improve its testing and benchmarking capabilities, its reliability, and its consistency, and developing new Continuous Integration pipelines based on it. The end goal is to evolve the event-generator and make it the standard tool for systematically accessing the correctness and performance of Falco‚Äôs threat detection capabilities at every release and development cycle

# What are the remaining tasks ? üó£Ô∏è
  - Improving benchmarking capabilities of event-generator
  - Integrate the enhanced event-generator in falco-ci pipleine

# Future Plans: ‚è≤Ô∏è
Following GSoC, I‚Äôm eager to maintain the same level of contribution and further engage with the community. I look forward to supporting new developers and exploring both new and existing projects within the organization. I am committed to being as helpful as possible to the community moving forward. üòá If anyone needs assistance or wishes to connect, I‚Äôm just a couple of clicks away.

# Conclusion üëè
I want to extend my heartfelt thanks to my mentors ‚ù§Ô∏è, Jason Dellaluce and Aldo Lacuku, for their unwavering support throughout my GSoC journey. Their patience and invaluable suggestions were crucial whenever I encountered challenges. I also appreciate the entire Falco community, especially Leonardo Grasso and Federico Di Pierro, for their exceptional assistance during the GSoC selection process. All of your help was instrumental in making this experience a success üî•.
